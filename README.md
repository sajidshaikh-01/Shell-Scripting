# Shell Scripting - Day 1 Summary

## 🔹 What is Shell Scripting?
Shell scripting is a way to automate Linux/Unix commands by writing them inside a file (script).  
It is used in DevOps for automation, CI/CD, and system management.

---

## 🔹 Variables
Variables are used to store and reuse data values in a script.  
Access variable values using `$variable_name`.

---

## 🔹 Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.  
Each element can be accessed using its index.  

---

## 🔹 Strings
A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text data.  
We can perform operations like length check, substring, or replacement.

---

## 🔹 User Interaction
Allows users to provide input while the script is running using the `read` command.  

---

## 🔹 Arithmetic Operations
Used to perform mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

---

## 🔹 Conditions
Used to make decisions in a script based on certain conditions (true or false).  

---

## 🔹 if Statement
Executes a block of code if a specific condition is true.  

---

## 🔹 if-else Statement
Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes another block.  

---

## 🔹 elif Statement
Used to check multiple conditions sequentially.  

---

## 🔹 case Statement
Used for multiple condition handling in a clean and readable format.
